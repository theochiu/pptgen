Verse 1:
Find me here, speak to me
I want to feel You, I need to hear You
You are the light that's leading me
To the place where I find peace again

Verse 2:
You are the strength that keeps me walking
You are the hope that keeps me trusting
You are the life to my soul
You are my purpose, You're everything

Chorus:
And how can I stand here with You
And not be moved by You
Would You tell me how could it be
Any better than this

Verse 3:
You calm the storms, You give me rest
You hold me in Your hand, You won't let me fall
You still my heart and You take my breath away
Would You take me in, take me deeper now

Chorus 2:
You're all I want, You're all I need
You're everything, everything
You're all I want, You're all I need
You're everything, everything
