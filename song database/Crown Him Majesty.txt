Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own

Verse 1 (part 2):
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for me
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity

Majesty, Lord of all
Let every throne before Him fall
The King of kings, O come adore
Our God who reigns forevermore

Verse 2:
Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save

Verse 2 (part 2):
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

All hail, Redeemer, hail
For He has died for me
His praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity

Ending:
Praise God who reigns forevermore
You're the God who reigns forevermore
