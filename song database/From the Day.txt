Verse 1:
When You found me, I was so blind
My sin was before me, I was swallowed by pride
But out of the darkness, You brought me to Your light
You showed me new mercy and opened up my eyes

Chorus:
From the day You saved my soul
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul

Verse 2:
Where brilliant light is all around
And endless joy is the only sound
Oh, rest my heart forever now
Oh, in Your arms I'll always be found

Chorus: 
From the day You saved my soul
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul

Bridge:
My love is Yours
My heart is Yours
My life is Yours
Forever

Chorus: 
From the day You saved my soul
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul
From the day You saved my soul

Chorus: 
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul
From the day You saved my soul
