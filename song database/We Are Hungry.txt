Verse:
Lord, I want more of You
Living water rain down on me
Lord, I need more of You
Living breath of life come fill me up

Chorus:
We are hungry, we are hungry
We are hungry for more of You
We are thirsty, oh Jesus
We are thirsty for more of You

Bridge:
We lift our holy hands up
We want to touch You
We lift our voices higher
And higher and higher to You
