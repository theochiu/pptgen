Verse 1:
Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
Leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
Still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God

Verse 2:
When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
Leaves the ninety-nine

Chorus (part 2):
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
Still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God

Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

Leaves the ninety-nine

Still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God
