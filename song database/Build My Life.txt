Verse 1:
Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You

Verse 2:
Jesus, the name above every other name
Jesus, the only one who could ever save
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You

Chorus:
Holy, there is no one like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder

Chorus b:
Show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love to those around me

Bridge: 
I will build my life upon Your love
It is a firm foundation
I will put my trust in You alone
And I will not be shaken
