Verse:
Holy
No measure knows Your worth
Face down
Where mercy finds me first

Pre-Chorus:
Whoa
If you sought perfection
Whoa
I'd die trying to reach it
Whoa
But this broken heart is all You want

Chorus:
Singing holy heart like heaven
Singing holy God almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your name
Singing holy is Your name

Bridge: 
Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singing holy is Your name
And if it lifts You higher
Burn in me Your desire
A passion worthy of Your name

Pre-Chorus 2:
Woah
And I'll throw my weakness
Woah
Into Your greatness
Woah
If this broken heart is all You want

Chorus:
Singing holy heart like heaven
Singing holy God almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your name
Singing holy is Your name

Chorus:
For you are worthy, Jesus Savior
You are worthy King forever
Hear my soul cry out
Singing holy is Your name
