Verse 1:
You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

Verse 2:
From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I’ve been born again, into a family
Your blood flows through my veins

Chorus:
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

Breakdown a:
I am surrounded
By the arms of the father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance

Breakdown b:
We've been liberated
From our bondage
Were the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom

Bridge a:
You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love

Bridge b:
You rescued me
And I will stand and sing
I am the child of God

Outro:
I am a child of God
