VERSE 1
He is jealous for me,
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree,
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.
When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
And how great Your affections are for me.

PRE-CHORUS
And, oh, how He loves us, oh,
Oh, how He loves us,
How He loves us all.

VERSE 1
And He is jealous for me,
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree,
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.
When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory.
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
And how great Your affections are for me.

PRE-CHORUS
And, oh, how He loves us, oh,
Oh, how He loves us,
How He loves us all

CHORUS
Yeah, He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves.

VERSE 2 
And we are His portion and He is our prize,
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes.
If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.
And Heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss,
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest.
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way...

CHORUS
That He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves.

CHORUS
Yeah, He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves.

CHORUS
Yeah, He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us.
Oh, how He loves us.
Oh, how He loves.
