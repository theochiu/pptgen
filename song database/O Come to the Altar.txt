Verse 1:
Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling

Chorus:
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ

Verse 2:
Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today there's no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes a new life is born
Jesus is calling

Bridge:
Oh what a savior
Isn't He wonderful?
Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen

Ending:
Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you found
