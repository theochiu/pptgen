All the girls in the bathroom talking
Who they gonna take to the Sadie Hawkins
My ears are burning but I kept on walking
Smile on my face and an air guitar rocking

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?

Sitting in the back of my next class napping
Got up, gave a speech, then bowed to the clapping
Told a funny joke, got the whole class laughing
Think I got a tan from the light which I was basking

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?

Scan the cafeteria for some good seating
I found a good spot by the cheerleaders eating
The quarterback asked me if I'd like a beating
I said that's one thing I won't be needing

And since I'm rather smart and cunning
I took off down the next hall running
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning

She said, "You're smooth and good with talking.
You're going with me to the Sadie Hawkins."

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?

The Sadie Hawkins Dance
In my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh oh oh
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?
