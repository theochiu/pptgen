How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night

Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul

What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of angels stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame

The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever

Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me

And out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me

Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
