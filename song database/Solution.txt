Verse 1:
It is not a human right to stare not fight
While broken nations dream
Open up our eyes so blind that we might find
The mercy for the need

Verse 2:
It is not too far a cry too much to try
And help the least of these
Politics will not decide if we should rise
And be Your hands and feet

Pre-Chorus:
Hey now fill our hearts with Your compassion
Hey now as we hold to our confession

Chorus:
Woah oh oh God be the solution
Woah oh oh
And we will be Your hands and be Your feet
(Oh run)

Verse 3:
Higher than all circumstance Your promise stands
Your love for all to see
Higher than our protest line and dollar signs
Your love is all we need

Bridge:
Only You can mend the broken heart
And cause the blind to see
Erase complete the sinner's past
And set the captives free

Bridge b:
Only You can take the widow's cry
And cause her heart to sing
Be the Father to the fatherless
Our Saviour to the King

Bridge c:
We will be Your hands
We will be Your feet
We will run the race for the least of these

Bridge d:
In the darkest place we will be Your light
We will be Your light

Tag:
We will run we will run
We will run with the solution
We will run we will run
We will run with the solution
