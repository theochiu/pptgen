VERSE 1:
There is Love
That came for us
Humbled to a sinner's cross
You broke my shame and sinfulness
You rose again victorious

VERSE 2:
Faithfulness none can deny
Through the storm
And through the fire
There is truth that sets me free
Jesus Christ who lives in me

CHORUS:
You are stronger
You are stronger
Sin is broken
You have saved me
It is written
Christ is risen
Jesus You are Lord of all

VERSE 3:
No beginning and no end
You're my hope and my defense
You came to seek and save the lost
You paid it all upon the cross

BRIDGE:
So let Your Name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher
Be lifted higher
