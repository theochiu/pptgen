Who You Say I Am
	

Who You Say I Am
	Who am I that the highest King 
	Would welcome me

Who You Say I Am
	I was lost but He brought me in
	Oh, His love for me 
	Oh, His love for me 

Who You Say I Am
	Who the Son sets free
	Oh is free indeed 
	I'm a child of God 
	Yes I am

Who You Say I Am
	Free at last 
	He has ransomed me
	His grace runs deep 

Who You Say I Am
	While I was a slave to sin
	Jesus died for me 
	Yes, He died for me 

Who You Say I Am
	Who the Son sets free
	Oh is free indeed 
	I'm a child of God 
	Yes I am

Who You Say I Am
	In my Father's house 
	There's a place for me 
	I'm a child of God 
	Yes I am

Who You Say I Am
	I am chosen 
	Not forsaken
	I am who You say I am

Who You Say I Am
	You are for me 
	Not against me
	I am who You say I am

	Verse 1:
	Let the King of my heart be 
	The mountain when I run
	The fountain I drink from; Oh
	He is my song
	Let the King of my heart be 
	The shadow where I hide
	The ransom for my life; oh
	He is my song

	You are good good, Oh   
	You are good, good Oh   

King Of My Heart
	Let the King of my heart be
	The wind inside my sails

	He is my song
	Let the King of my heart be 
	The fire inside my veins
	And the echo of my days; Oh
	He is my song

	Never gonna let me down
