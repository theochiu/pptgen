rom The Day
	When You found me, I was so blind
	My sin was before me, I was swallowed by pride
	But out of the darkness, You brought me to Your light
	You showed me new mercy and opened up my eyes

rom The Day
	From the day You saved my soul
	'Til the very moment when I come home
	I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
	From the day You saved my soul

rom The Day
	Where brilliant light is all around
	And endless joy is the only sound
	Oh, rest my heart forever now
	Oh, in Your arms I'll always be found

rom The Day
	From the day You saved my soul
	'Til the very moment when I come home

	From the day You saved my soul

rom The Day
	My love is Yours
	My heart is Yours
	My life is Yours
	Forever

rom The Inside Out
	A thousand times I've failed
	Still Your mercy remains 
	And should I stumble again
	I'm caught in Your grace

rom The Inside Out
	Everlasting
	Your light will shine when all else fades
	Never ending
	Your glory goes beyond all fame

rom The Inside Out
	Your will above all else
	My purpose remains
	The art of losing myself
	In bringing You praise

rom The Inside Out
	My heart and my soul
	Lord I give You control
	Consume me from the inside out, Lord
	Let justice and praise
	Become my embrace
	To love you from the inside out

rom The Inside Out
	Everlasting
	Your light will shine when all else fades
	Never ending
	Your glory goes beyond all fame
	And the cry of my heart
	Is to bring You praise
	From the inside out
	Lord my soul cries out
