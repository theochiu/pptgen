Verse 1:
Humble King, Holy One
Friend of sinners, God's own Son
God in flesh among men
You walked my road, You understand

Verse 2:
Servant King, friend to me
You saved my soul, washed my feet
Here I'll bow, give all to You
Lord I want to be like You

Chorus:
All I want, all I need
More of You, less of me
Take this life, Lord it's Yours
Have my heart, have it all

Verse 3:
I will walk in Your ways
Love Your word, seek Your face
My reward, my sole pursuit
To know You more, to be like You

Bridge:
Jesus, Jesus
All I want is to be like You
Jesus, Jesus
All I want is to be like You
