Verse 1:
Here is love, vast as the ocean
Lovingkindness as the flood
When the Price of Life, our ransom
Shed for us His precious blood

Chorus 1:
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten
Throughout heaven's eternal days

Verse 2:
On the mount of crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and wide
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide

Chorus 2:
Grace and love, like mighty rivers
Poured incessant from above
And heaven's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love

Verse 3:
Let me all Thy love accepting
Love Thee, ever all my day
Let me seek Thy kingdom only
And my life be to Thy praise

Chorus 3:
Thou alone shall be my glory
Nothing in the world I see
Thou has cleansed and sanctified me
Thou Thyself hast set me free

Bridge:
No love is higher, no love is wider
No love is deeper, no love is truer
