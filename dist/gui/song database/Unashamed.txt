Verse 1:
I have not much to offer You
Not near what You deserve
But still I come because Your cross
Has placed in me my worth

Verse 2:
O Christ my King of sympathy
Whose wounds secure my peace
Your grace extends to call me friend
Your mercy sets me free

Chorus:
And I know I'm weak
I know I'm unworthy
To call upon Your name
But because of grace
Because of Your mercy
I stand here unashamed

Verse 3:
I can't explain this kind of love
I'm humbled and amazed
That You'd come down from heaven's heights
And greet me face to face

Bridge:
Here I am at Your feet
In my brokenness complete
