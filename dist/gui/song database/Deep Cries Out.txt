Verse 
I've got a river of living water 
A fountain that never will run dry 
It's an open heaven You're releasing
And we will never be denied

Pre-Chorus
'Cause we're stirring up deep-deep wells, 
We're stirring up deep-deep waters
We're gonna dance in the river, dance in the river
'Cause we're stirring up deep-deep wells, 
We're stirring up deep-deep waters
We're gonna jump in the river, jump in the river

Chorus
Deep cries out, deep cries out to You
Deep cries out, deep cries out to You
We cry out, we cry out to You, Jesus
