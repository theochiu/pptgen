Verse 1:
I once was fatherless, a stranger with no hope
Your kindness wakened me, wakened me from my sleep
Your love it beckons deeply, a call to come and die
By grace now I will come and take this life, take Your life

Pre-Chorus:        
Sin has lost its power, death has lost its sting
From the grave You've risen victoriously

Chorus:
Into marvelous light I'm running, out of darkness, out of shame,
By the cross You are the truth, You are the life, You are the way

Verse 2:
My dead heart now is beating, my deepest stains now clean
Your breath fills up my lungs, now I'm free, now I'm free

Bridge:
Lift my hands and spin around
See the light that I have found
Oh the marvelous light
Marvelous light
