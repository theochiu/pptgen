Verse 1a:
It's falling from the clouds
A strange and lovely sound
I hear it in the thunder and rain

Verse 1b:
It's ringing in the skies
Like cannons in the night
The music of the universe plays

Chorus A:
You are holy great and mighty
The moon and the stars declare who You are

Chorus B:
I'm so unworthy, but still You love me
Forever my heart will sing of how great You are

Verse 2a:
Beautiful and free
Song of Galaxies
It's reaching far beyond the milky way

Verse 2b:
Lets join in with the sound
C'mon let's sing it loud
As the music of the universe plays

Bridge:
All glory, honor, power is Yours amen
All glory, honor, power is Yours amen
All glory, honor, power is Yours forever amen
