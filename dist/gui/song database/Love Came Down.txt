Verse 1:
If my heart is overwhelmed
And I cannot hear Your voice
I hold on to what is true
Though I cannot see

Verse 1b:
If the storms of life they come
And the road ahead gets steep
I will lift these hands in faith
I will believe

Verse 1c:
I'll remind myself
Of all that You've done
And the life I have
Because of Your son

Chorus:
Love came down and rescued me
Love came down and set me free
I am Yours
Lord I'm forever Yours
Mountains high or valley low
I sing out and remind my soul
I am Yours
I am forever Yours

Verse 2:
When my heart is filled with hope
Every promise comes my way
When I feel Your hands of grace
Rest upon me

Verse 2b:
Staying desperate for You, God
Staying humble at Your feet
I will lift these hands in praise
I will believe

Verse 2c:
I'll remind myself
Of all that You've done
And the life I have
Because of Your son
