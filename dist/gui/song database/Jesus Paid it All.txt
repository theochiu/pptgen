Verse 1:
I hear the Savior say
“Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness, watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all.” 

Chorus:
Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

Verse 2:
Lord, now indeed I find 
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots 
And melt the heart of stone 

Verse 3:
And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

Bridge:
O praise the One who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
O praise the One who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
