Verse 1:
Let the King of my heart be 
The mountain when I run
The fountain I drink from; Oh
He is my song
Let the King of my heart be 
The shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life; oh
He is my song

Chorus:
You are good good, Oh   
You are good, good Oh   

Verse 2:
Let the King of my heart be
The wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves; Oh
He is my song
Let the King of my heart be 
The fire inside my veins
And the echo of my days; Oh
He is my song

Bridge 1:
You're never gonna let
Never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let
Never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let,
Never gonna let me down
You're never gonna let
Never gonna let me down


Bridge 2:
You're never gonna let,
Never gonna let me down
