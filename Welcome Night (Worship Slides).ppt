Good Good Father (Verse 1)

How He Loves
	

How He Loves (VERSE 1)
	He is jealous for me,
	Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree,
	Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.
	When all of a sudden,
	I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
	And I realize just how beautiful You are,
	And how great Your affections are for me.

How He Loves (PRE-CHORUS)
	And, oh, how He loves us, oh,
	Oh, how He loves us,
	How He loves us all.

	And we are His portion and He is our prize,
	Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes.
	If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.
	And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
	And my heart turns violently inside of my chest.
	I don't have time to maintain these regrets
	When I think about the way...

How He Loves (CHORUS)
	That He loves us,
	Oh, how He loves us,
	Oh, how He loves us,
	Oh, how He loves.
