Revelation Song
	

Revelation Song
	Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
	Holy, holy is He
	Sing a new song to Him who sits on
	Heaven's mercy seat

Revelation Song
	Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
	Who was and is and is to come
	With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings
	You are my everything and I will adore You

Revelation Song
	Clothed in rainbows of living color
	Flashes of lighting rolls of thunder
	Blessing and honor strength and glory and power be
	To You the only wise King

Revelation Song
	Filled with wonder awestruck wonder
	At the mention of Your name
	Jesus Your name is power, breath and living water
	Such a marvelous mystery

Revelation Song
	Oh, You're worthy, mystery
	You are worthy

Revelation Song
	Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
	Who was and is and is to come
	With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings

Living Hope
	

Living Hope
	How great the chasm that lay between us
	How high the mountain I could not climb
	In desperation, I turned to heaven
	And spoke Your name into the night

Living Hope
	Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
	Tore through the shadows of my soul
	The work is &#64257;nished, the end is written
	Jesus Christ, my living hope

Living Hope
	Who could imagine so great a mercy?
	What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
	The God of angels stepped down from glory
	To wear my sin and bear my shame

Living Hope
	The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
	The King of kings calls me His own
	Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
	Jesus Christ, my living hope

Living Hope
	Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
	Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
	You have broken every chain
	There's salvation in Your name
	Jesus Christ, my living hope

Living Hope
	Then came the morning that sealed the promise
	Your buried body began to breathe
	Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
	Declared the grave has no claim on me

Living Hope
	Then came the morning that sealed the promise
	Your buried body began to breathe
	And out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
	Declared the grave has no claim on me
	Jesus, Yours is the victory!

Living Hope
	Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
	Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
	You have broken every chain
	There's salvation in Your name
	Jesus Christ, my living hope




Cornerstone
	

Cornerstone
	My hope is built on nothing less
	Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
	I dare not trust the sweetest frame
	But wholly trust in Jesus' name

Cornerstone
	Christ alone, Cornerstone
	Weak made strong in the Savior's love
	Through the storm
	He is Lord
	Lord of all

Cornerstone
	When darkness seems to hide His face
	I rest on His unchanging grace
	In every high and stormy gale
	My anchor holds within the veil

Cornerstone
	He is Lord
	Lord of all

Cornerstone
	When He shall come with trumpet sound
	Oh, may I then in Him be found
	Dressed in His righteousness alone
	Faultless stand before the throne
