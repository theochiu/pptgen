Love Came Down
	

Love Came Down
	

Love Came Down
	If my heart is overwhelmed
	And I cannot hear Your voice
	I hold on to what is true
	Though I cannot see

Love Came Down
	If the storms of life they come
	And the road ahead gets steep
	I will lift these hands in faith
	I will believe

Love Came Down
	I'll remind myself
	Of all that You've done
	And the life I have
	Because of Your son

Love Came Down
	Love came down and rescued me
	Love came down and set me free
	I am Yours
	Lord I'm forever Yours
	Mountains high or valley low
	I sing out and remind my soul
	I am Yours
	I am forever Yours

Love Came Down
	When my heart is filled with hope
	Every promise comes my way
	When I feel Your hands of grace
	Rest upon me

Love Came Down
	Staying desperate for You, God
	Staying humble at Your feet
	I will lift these hands in praise
	I will believe




It Is Well
	

It Is Well
	Grander earth has quaked before
	Moved by the sound of His voice
	Seas that are shaken and stirred
	Can be calmed and broken for my regard

It Is Well
	Through it all, through it all
	My eyes are on You
	Through it all, through it all
	It is well

It Is Well
	Through it all, through it all
	My eyes are on You
	It is well with me

It Is Well
	Far be it from me to not believe
	Even when my eyes can't see
	And this mountain that's in front of me
	Will be thrown into the midst of the sea

It Is Well
	Through it all, through it all
	My eyes are on You
	Through it all, through it all
	It is well

It Is Well
	So let go my soul and trust in Him
	The waves and wind still know His name 




Everything
	

Everything
	Find me here, speak to me
	I want to feel You, I need to hear You
	You are the light that's leading me
	To the place where I find peace again

Everything
	You are the strength that keeps me walking
	You are the hope that keeps me trusting
	You are the life to my soul
	You are my purpose, You're everything

Everything
	And how can I stand here with You
	And not be moved by You
	Would You tell me how could it be
	Any better than this

Everything
	You calm the storms, You give me rest
	You hold me in Your hand, You won't let me fall
	You still my heart and You take my breath away
	Would You take me in, take me deeper now

Everything
	You're all I want, You're all I need
	You're everything, everything
	You're all I want, You're all I need
	You're everything, everything
