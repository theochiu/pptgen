Reckless Love
	

Reckless Love
	Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
	You have been so, so good to me
	Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
	You have been so, so kind to me

Reckless Love
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God
	Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
	Leaves the ninety-nine

Reckless Love
	I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
	Still, You give Yourself away
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God

Reckless Love
	When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
	You have been so, so good to me
	When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
	You have been so, so kind to me

Reckless Love
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God
	Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
	Leaves the ninety-nine

Reckless Love
	I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
	Still, You give Yourself away
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God

Reckless Love
	There's no shadow You won't light up
	Mountain You won't climb up
	Coming after me

Reckless Love
	There's no wall You won't kick down
	Lie You won't tear down
	Coming after me

Reckless Love
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God
	Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
	Leaves the ninety-nine

Reckless Love
	I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
	Still, You give Yourself away
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God
