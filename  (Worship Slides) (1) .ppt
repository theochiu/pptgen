Brokenness Aside
	

Brokenness Aside
	Will your grace run out
	If I let you down 
	Cause all I know
	Is how to run

Brokenness Aside
	Cause I am a sinner 
	If its not one thing its another
	Caught up in words 
	Tangled in lies
	You are the Savior 
	And you take brokenness aside
	And make it beautiful 
	Beautiful 

Brokenness Aside
	Will you call me child
	When I tell you lies 
	Cause all I know 
	Is how to cry 

Brokenness Aside
	You make it beautiful
	You make it beautiful




Came To My Rescue
	

Came To My Rescue
	Falling on my knees in worship
	Giving all I am to seek Your face
	Lord all I am is Yours

Came To My Rescue
	My whole life I place in Your hands
	God of mercy Humbled I bow down
	In your presence at Your throne

Came To My Rescue
	I called You answered
	And You came to my rescue and I,
	I wanna be where You are

Came To My Rescue
	In my life be lifted high
	In our world be lifted high
	In our love be lifted high




Cornerstone
	

Cornerstone
	My hope is built on nothing less
	Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
	I dare not trust the sweetest frame
	But wholly trust in Jesus' name

Cornerstone
	Christ alone, Cornerstone
	Weak made strong in the Savior's love
	Through the storm
	He is Lord
	Lord of all

Cornerstone
	When darkness seems to hide His face
	I rest on His unchanging grace
	In every high and stormy gale
	My anchor holds within the veil

Cornerstone
	He is Lord
	Lord of all

Cornerstone
	When He shall come with trumpet sound
	Oh, may I then in Him be found
	Dressed in His righteousness alone
	Faultless stand before the throne
