
You never let go
	

You never let go
	Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
	Your perfect love is casting out fear
	
You never let go
	And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life
	I won't turn back I know you are near

You never let go
	And I will fear no evil
	For my God is with me
	And if my God is with me
	Whom then shall I fear?
	Whom then shall I fear?

You never let go
	Oh no, You never let go
	Through the calm and through the storm
	Oh no, You never let go
	In every high and every low
	Oh no, You never let go
	Lord, You never let go of me

You never let go
	And I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
	A glorious light beyond all compare
	
You never let go
	And there will be an end to these troubles
	But until that day comes
	We'll live to know You here on the earth

You never let go
	Yes, I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
	And there will be an end to these troubles
	But until that day comes
	Still I will praise You, still I will praise You




Reckless Love
	

Reckless Love
	Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
	You have been so, so good to me
	Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
	You have been so, so kind to me

Reckless Love
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God
	Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
	Leaves the ninety-nine

Reckless Love
	I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
	Still, You give Yourself away
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God

Reckless Love
	When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
	You have been so, so good to me
	When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
	You have been so, so kind to me

Reckless Love
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God
	Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
	Leaves the ninety-nine

Reckless Love
	I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
	Still, You give Yourself away
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God

Reckless Love
	There's no shadow You won't light up
	Mountain You won't climb up
	Coming after me

Reckless Love
	There's no wall You won't kick down
	Lie You won't tear down
	Coming after me

Reckless Love
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God
	Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, 
	Leaves the ninety-nine

Reckless Love
	I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
	Still, You give Yourself away
	Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
	Reckless love of God




O Come to the Altar
	

O Come to the Altar
	Are you hurting and broken within?
	Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
	Jesus is calling

O Come to the Altar
	Have you come to the end of yourself
	Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
	Jesus is calling

O Come to the Altar
	O come to the altar
	The Father's arms are open wide
	Forgiveness was bought with
	The precious blood of Jesus Christ

O Come to the Altar
	Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
	Come today there's no reason to wait
	Jesus is calling

O Come to the Altar
	Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
	From the ashes a new life is born
	Jesus is calling

O Come to the Altar
	Oh what a savior
	Isn't He wonderful?
	Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen

O Come to the Altar
	Bow down before Him
	For He is Lord of all
	Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen

O Come to the Altar
	Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
	Tell the world of the treasure you found
