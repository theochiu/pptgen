Verse 1:
Will your grace run out
If I let you down 
Cause all I know
Is how to run

Chorus:
Cause I am a sinner 
If its not one thing its another
Caught up in words 
Tangled in lies
You are the Savior 
And you take brokenness aside
And make it beautiful 
Beautiful 

Verse 2:
Will you call me child
When I tell you lies 
Cause all I know 
Is how to cry 

Bridge: 
You make it beautiful
You make it beautiful
