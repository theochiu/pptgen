Verse 1:
Skies spin their dance within Your breath
Time runs its race within Your hand
And my mind runs wild to comprehend
What no mind on earth could understand

Chorus:
Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are wilder
Love came like madness
Poured out in blood wash romance
It makes no sense but this is grace
And I know You're with me in this place

Bridge 1:
Here now, all I know is I know that You are
Here now, still my heart, let Your voice be all I
Hear now
Spirit breathe like the wind come have Your way
'Cause I know You're in this place

Verse 2:
Faith makes a fool of what makes sense
But grace found my heart where logic ends
When justice called for all my debts
The friend of sinners came instead

Bridge 2:
Here now, all I know is I know that You are
Here now, still my heart, let Your voice be all I
Hear now
Spirit breathe like the wind come have Your way
'Cause I know You are

Bridge 3:
Here now, heart and soul God I know that You are
Here now, fix my eyes on the things that I can't
See now, and all I see is the glory of Your Name
'Cause I know that you are

Bridge 4:
Here now, still my heart, let Your voice be all I
Hear now, fix my eyes on the things that
I can't See now, Spirit breathe like the wind
Come have Your way
