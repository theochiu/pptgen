Verse 1:
You are the source of life
I can't be left behind
No one else will do
I will take hold of You

Chorus:
I need You Jesus to come to my rescue
Where else can I go?
There's no other name by which I am saved
Capture me with grace, I will follow You

Verse 2: 
My heart is yours for life
And I need your hand in mine
No one else will do
I put my trust in you 

Bridge:
This world has nothing for me
(I will follow You)
This world has nothing for me
(I will follow You)
