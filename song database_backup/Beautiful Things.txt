Verse 1:
All this pain      
I wonder if I'll ever find my way
I wonder if my life could really change at all 
 
Verse 2:
All this earth
Could all that is lost ever be found
Could a garden come up from this ground at all 
 
Chorus:
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of the dust
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of us
 
Verse 3:
All around
Hope is springing up from this old ground
Out of chaos life is being found in You 
 
Bridge:
You make me new 
You are making me new
