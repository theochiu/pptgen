Verse 1:
Falling on my knees in worship
Giving all I am to seek Your face
Lord all I am is Yours

Verse 2:
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of mercy Humbled I bow down
In your presence at Your throne

Chorus:
I called You answered
And You came to my rescue and I,
I wanna be where You are

Bridge:
In my life be lifted high
In our world be lifted high
In our love be lifted high
