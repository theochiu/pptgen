Verse:
I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again

Chorus:
Amazing love, how can it be
That You, my King, would die for me?
Amazing love, I know it's true
It's my joy to honor You
In all I do I honor You

Bridge:
You are my king
You are my king
Jesus, You are my king
Jesus, You are my king
