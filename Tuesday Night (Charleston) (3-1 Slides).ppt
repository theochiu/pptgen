From the Day
	

From the Day
	When You found me, I was so blind
	My sin was before me, I was swallowed by pride
	But out of the darkness, You brought me to Your light
	You showed me new mercy and opened up my eyes

From the Day
	From the day You saved my soul
	'Til the very moment when I come home
	I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
	From the day You saved my soul

From the Day
	Where brilliant light is all around
	And endless joy is the only sound
	Oh, rest my heart forever now
	Oh, in Your arms I'll always be found

From the Day
	From the day You saved my soul
	'Til the very moment when I come home
	I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow

From the Day
	My love is Yours
	My heart is Yours
	My life is Yours
	Forever

From the Day

Living Hope
	

Living Hope
	How great the chasm that lay between us
	How high the mountain I could not climb
	In desperation, I turned to heaven
	And spoke Your name into the night

Living Hope
	Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
	Tore through the shadows of my soul
	The work is &#64257;nished, the end is written
	Jesus Christ, my living hope

Living Hope
	Who could imagine so great a mercy?
	What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
	The God of angels stepped down from glory
	To wear my sin and bear my shame

Living Hope
	The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
	The King of kings calls me His own
	Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
	Jesus Christ, my living hope

Living Hope
	Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
	Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
	You have broken every chain
	There's salvation in Your name
	Jesus Christ, my living hope

Living Hope
	Then came the morning that sealed the promise
	Your buried body began to breathe
	Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
	Declared the grave has no claim on me

Living Hope
	Then came the morning that sealed the promise
	Your buried body began to breathe
	And out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
	Declared the grave has no claim on me
	Jesus, Yours is the victory!

Living Hope
	Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
	Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
	You have broken every chain
	There's salvation in Your name

No Longer Slaves
	

No Longer Slaves
	You unravel me, with a melody
	You surround me with a song
	Of deliverance, from my enemies
	Till all my fears are gone

No Longer Slaves
	Im no longer a slave to fear
	I am a child of God
	Im no longer a slave to fear
	I am a child of God

No Longer Slaves
	From my mothers womb
	You have chosen me
	Love has called my name
	Ive been born again, into a family
	Your blood flows through my veins

No Longer Slaves
	Im no longer a slave to fear
	I am a child of God
	Im no longer a slave to fear
	I am a child of God

No Longer Slaves
	I am surrounded
	By the arms of the father
	I am surrounded
	By songs of deliverance

No Longer Slaves
	We've been liberated
	From our bondage
	Were the sons and the daughters
	Let us sing our freedom

No Longer Slaves
	You split the sea
	So I could walk right through it
	My fears were drowned in perfect love

No Longer Slaves
	You rescued me
	And I will stand and sing
	I am the child of God

No Longer Slaves
	I am a child of God
